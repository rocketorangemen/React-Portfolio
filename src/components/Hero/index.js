            After attending the University of Mary-Hardin Baylor for 1 year to play football, I returned to my hometown of Corpus Christi to work for a few years. I saw many opportunities in Austin and decided to move here in 2018. I've worked in communications for about 4 years and I enjoy the process of solving problems so I decided that a career in the tech/software industry. I completed a Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp at the University of Texas at Austin and received my certificate in June 2021. I became a first time parent after completing the boot camp and it has been amazing, despite the limited sleeping hours. I am actively learning and increasing my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express and React while a creating a full stack application.
