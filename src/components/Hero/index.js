            After attending the University of Mary-Hardin Baylor for 1 year to play football, I returned to my hometown of Corpus Christi to work for a few years. I saw many opportunities in Austin and decided to move here in 2018. I've worked in communications for about 4 years and I enjoy the process of solving problems I decided that I wanted to work in the tech/software industry. I completed a Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp at the University of Texas at Austin and received my certificate in June 2021. I became a first time parent after completing the boot camp and it has been amazing, despite the limited sleeping hours. I am actively learning and increasing my skills in a creating a full stack application. Thank you for your time!
